#### Exploratory data analysis for the [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) dataset from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)

#### Full Analysis : [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/axrozwadowska/Kaggle_Titanic_Competition/blob/master/titanic_project.ipynb)

##### This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the first challenge for me to dive into Machine Learning. I used machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic disaster.


### Python Packages:

* numpy
* pandas
* pickle
* seaborn
* sklearn
* statistics


### Classification Models Used:

* k-Nearest Neighbours
* Random Forests
* Support Vector Machine


### ROC Curve of my models:
